Question: What should the character do right now to progress?
Response: Based on the image, the character is on a grassy plain with trees. To progress, the character needs to kill 8 creatures on each level to open the ladders. Since this is the first level (the overworld), the character needs to kill 8 creatures.  Therefore, the character should **do** (press space) to attack any nearby creatures.
