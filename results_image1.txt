=== Q4 ===
Question: What should the character do right now to progress?
Response: Based on the image, the character is in a grassy area with trees. There are no ladders, chests, or creatures to interact with. To progress, the character needs to find a ladder on each floor. Since this is the first level (the overworld), the character needs to find a ladder. Since there are no ladders visible, the character should explore the surrounding area to find one.

Therefore, the character should explore. There is no specific action to take based on the image to progress.

=== Q5 ===
Question: What should the character do in the future?
Response: Based on the image, the character is on a grassy plain with trees. The goal is to find ladders to descend to the next level. Since the character is on the overworld, there are no ladders to find. Therefore, the character should try to find a dungeon or a level with ladders to descend.

The most logical action is to move forward (w) to explore the area in front of them.
